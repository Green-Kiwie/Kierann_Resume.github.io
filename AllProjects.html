										<p>After reading Marting Pring's "Technical Analysis Explained" book, I wrote a python program with Pandas and yFinance to scan the S&P 500 for candlestick patterns, thereby predicting price movements.<br><br>
											However, after backtesting my code, it seemed like the algorithm was not profitable. Though the algorithm was relatively accurate, the average loss on mispredictions were more than the average profit.<br><br>
											I knew that there must be a better way.<br>

										<p>My explorations with technical analysis started right before the emergence of ChatGPT. Experimenting with the capabilities of Large Neural Networks, I thought that Neural Network was the approach to my stock market algorithm. <br><br>
											I understood the foundations of Neural Networks and other machine learning algorithms by studying the "Advanced Learning Algorithms" Course by DeepLearning.AI.

									</div>
								</para>
								<para>
									<div class="text">
										<p>Upon completing the course, I set up to try out training a Neural Network to predict the S&P 500 stocks. <br><br>
											I wrote a Neural Network with 3 layers, a LSTM, Relu and Sigmod layers. The second and third layers have 64 and 32 nodes respectively. The Neural Network then outputs a binary value, buy or sell. <br><br>
											Testing this Network of arbitrary number of layers and nodes, I acheived an accuracy of just above 50% on average. The results were far from satisfactory and the model was evidently overfitting.

									<div class="text">
										<p>Overfitting, I read, could be solved by inputting more data or reducing the model complexity. Since I took the maximum daily data allowed by the yFinance API, I decided to reduce the model complexity instead. <br> <br>
											Herein lies the question: what should be my ideal complexity? Instead of guessing, I decided to brute force an experiment. I set up a 2 dimensional loop, each loop testing the number of nodes for a layer. I then collated the accuracy of the models in a 2 dimensional array. 
										</p>
									</div>
								</para>
								<para>
									<div class="text">
										<p>Finally, I ended up with the best model of 3 node per layer, with a accuracy of 57%. <br><br>
											Though the model was far from profitable, it took too long to run my program and I decided to put my project on pause till I upgrade my computer!

										<p>I first heard of time complexity during my <a href="Experience.html#DSO">internship with Defence Science Organization (Singapore) </a>Then, I learnt how using a different approach could allow me to solve the shortest vector in a shorter (polynomial) time than the naive algorithm with exponential time. <br><br>
											There was something about trying different approaches and modifying current solutions that I cannot stop thinking about. When I found out that there was a website that allows me to do just that, I quickly registered. <br> <br>

										<p> Initially, part of a simple school presentation, my team and I were to come up with a way to give back to the community. Then, we thought that we could leverage on the Excel Skills we learnt in school to share the knowledge with other students who did not get the opportunity to learn Excel in school. <br> <br>
											After completing the presentation, I realized that the plan was feasbile. I wrote in to the Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC) who quickly accepted my proposal.

											To ensure program can run reliably, the C++ program register itself in the computer registry and thereby run on the startup of the computer. After implementing this feature, I noticed that my program could not run.
